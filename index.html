                  <h2>Pokemon Silver</h2>
                  <p>Pokemon Silver is one of the earliest games from childhood. I can remember constantly restarting this game, barely understanding what I was supposed to do. My favorite starter pokemon to this day comes from Silver and it is cyndaquil! Totodile came as a very close second but the little fiery always kepy my heart. I was around 6 when my parents gifted me with my first gameboy. While there were newer games out Pokemon Silver was a game they had decided to get for me. It remained difficult for me to play for me to play until I had a better grasp on reading but the little mons fighting for me was more than enough to keep me playing as a child.</p>

                  <a name = "Metroid Prime"></a>
                  <h2>Metroid Prime</h2>
                  <p>Metroid Prime was I started playing WAY to young. I had no concept of objectives or how to follow a story as complicated as this one. This did not stop me from putting countless hours of my early years blasting and rolling my way through the countless hordes of pirates. I may not have known where to go but I sure knew how to fight my way there. Samus Aran will be one of my favorite video game heroines most likely until the day I die. The vast amounts of knowledge and lore this series provided was beyond what the mind of a 6 year old me was prepared for. Eventually beating this game as young as I was gave me the confidence to keep going and play similar games.</p>

                  <a name = "The Legend Of Zelda Wind Waker"></a>
                  <h2>The Legend of Zelda Wind Waker</h2>
                  <P>The Legend of Zelda is a series that has a permanent chunk of my heart. Growing up I played both Ocarina of Time and Wind Waker, but Wind Waker was always my preferred game. The cartoonish style and the ridiculous faces that link would make had me loving the game for years. I have found myself to this day pulling out my old gamecube and playing through once or twice. The puzzles and challenges while difficult enough to keep me engaged were also easy enough to allow a child to figure it out. Finding all of the broken triforce pieces will forever be engraved in my mind as a daunting task, even though I know I can easily do it now.</P>

                  <a name = "World of Warcraft"></a>
                  <h2>World of Warcraft</h2>
                  <p>World of Warcraft came out right around the time I really learned to read. I remember sitting in the computer room my parents played in so I could take peaks of the game and try to learn from them. While I was never allowed to raid with my parents I was first allowed to play my own character on their account. I was so excited as this was my very first computer game and my first mmorpg. I spent so much time hanging around Westfall and Ashenvale. I fell prey to many pvp griefers and people killing my quest givers. WoW was a brutal battleground back in the day. It helped me be patient and while I never got a character about level 40 back then, Word of Warcraft continued to be a staple in my life well into my 20s.</p>
